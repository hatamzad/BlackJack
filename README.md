This repository contains a simple console-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack in Python.

Overview:

The game allows a player to play Blackjack against a dealer, with the following features:

	•	Card and Deck Management:
	•	The Card class represents individual cards with a suit and rank.
	•	The Deck class creates a full deck of 52 cards, shuffles it, and handles dealing cards.
	•	Hand Management:
	•	The Hand class manages the cards held by the player and the dealer, calculates the hand’s value, and adjusts for the Ace’s dual value (1 or 11).
	•	Chip Management:
	•	The Chips class tracks the player’s total chips, manages bets, and updates the total based on wins or losses.
	•	Gameplay:
	•	The game prompts the player to place bets, deal cards, and decide whether to ‘Hit’ or ‘Stand’.
	•	The dealer’s hand is revealed according to Blackjack rules, and the game determines the winner based on the final hand values.
	•	Players can choose to play multiple rounds, with their chip total being carried over.
